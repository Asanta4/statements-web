# Security Fix: OpenAI API Key Protection

## What Was Fixed

Your OpenAI API key was being exposed in client-side JavaScript code. This caused OpenAI to automatically disable your key as a security measure. The fix moves all OpenAI API calls to a secure serverless function on Netlify's backend.

## Changes Made

1. **Created Netlify Function** (`netlify/functions/analyze-check.js`)
   - Serverless function that runs on Netlify's backend
   - Handles all OpenAI API calls securely
   - API key never exposed to browser

2. **Updated Frontend Service** (`src/services/gptService.ts`)
   - Removed direct OpenAI API calls
   - Now calls Netlify Function endpoint instead
   - No API key needed in frontend code

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Netlify Environment Variables

Go to your Netlify dashboard:
1. Navigate to **hila-statements.com** site settings
2. Go to **Site configuration** → **Environment variables**
3. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (without quotes)
   - **Scopes**: Select all deploy contexts (Production, Deploy Previews, Branch deploys)

### 2. Get a New OpenAI API Key

Since your old key was compromised:
1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Delete/revoke the old exposed key
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy it immediately (you won't see it again)
5. Add it to Netlify as described above

### 3. Remove Local .env File API Key

Update your local `.env` file:
```bash
# Remove or comment out this line - no longer needed in frontend
# VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 4. Test Locally (Optional)

To test the functions locally before deploying:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Link your site
netlify link

# Create a local .env file for the function (NOT tracked by git)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here" > .env

# Run both Vite and Netlify Dev together
netlify dev
```

This will start:
- Vite dev server on port 5173
- Netlify Functions on port 8888
- Proxy that connects them

### 5. Deploy

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Move OpenAI API calls to serverless function for security"

# Push to trigger Netlify deployment
git push origin main
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

After deployment:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for any errors
2. Test the check analysis feature on your live site
3. Verify no API key is visible in browser DevTools Network tab
4. Confirm the API key is not in the JavaScript bundle

## Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit API keys to Git** - Even in private repos, they can be exposed
2. **API keys in frontend = instant compromise** - OpenAI scans for exposed keys 24/7
3. **Use environment variables** - Always store secrets in environment variables
4. **Netlify Functions are secure** - They run on the backend, not in browsers
5. **Different keys for different environments** - Use separate keys for dev/staging/production

## How the Fix Works

**Before (Insecure):**
```
Browser → OpenAI API (with exposed key)
```

**After (Secure):**
```
Browser → Netlify Function → OpenAI API
         (no key needed)    (key stored securely)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the API key still gets disabled:
1. Check if old deployments are still running with the exposed key
2. Ensure you're not committing the key anywhere in the code
3. Verify the .env file is properly gitignored
4. Check browser console for any key exposure

### If the function doesn't work:
1. Check Netlify function logs in the dashboard
2. Verify environment variable is set correctly (no quotes, no spaces)
3. Ensure the function path is correct: `/.netlify/functions/analyze-check`
4. Check CORS settings if getting cross-origin errors

## Support

If you continue having issues:
1. Double-check all environment variable settings
2. Review Netlify function logs for errors
3. Ensure you're using a fresh, uncompromised API key
4. Consider implementing rate limiting and usage monitoring on your OpenAI account
